Una

Innovation
* large corporations
* government funding
* open source

Corporations
* Bill Gates
* his family was really well off
* he went to lakeside academy, which was a really expensive school
* this school has a computer terminal
* He used it a lot and gained a lot of experience thru access. 

Open Source Diversity
* open source is broken
* the story of the road: 
* business person, we need a road 
* engineer, we will build it structurally like this 
* designer, we will make it pretty like this

Open Source tends to lack designers. 
* designers don't do things for free
* designers don't want to break the code
* unfamiliarity paralysis - we don't know how to start
* design by committee is a terrible thing
* GitHub, for instance, is not a tool for designers

We can teach Git to designers by celebrating little wins.

Communication, let them know we want their contributions
Accessibility, 
* can someone easily start to use it? 
* be explicit with instructions.
* add commonly used terms

Many more females contribute to projects with documentation, a website, and a demo.

Respect, see design as an important part of the project not just an afterthough nice-to-have

Empathy
* avoid argument culture
* ask, don't tell... why did you decide to do X?
* be specific... when you are calling X...
* explain yourself... the reason I would do it this way is...
* offer solutions... maybe try...
* avoid hyperbole... its never always something 
* use emojis...

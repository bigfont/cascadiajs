When starting remote work, missed the office antics the most. 
It was hard to maintain the sense of togetherness.
Multiple timezones were particularly difficult to manage. 
1/3 of the 30 person team is now remote. 

Non-Magical Small Choices for a Happy Remote Workplace
* choose to be a leader
* choose to make the health, happiness, and positivity of your team a priority. 
* choose to be part of building and maintaining an awesome team
* choose to accept that communication is a struggle

The core problem with remote work is *lack of connection*
* physical proximity can make us feel more connected than we actually are
* it's important to bolster that with actual psychological connection
* being a distributed team can force psychological connection

How can we make psychological connections
* put people first, you must care about your coworkers
* find and focus on the things that unite you, share your values/goals/shared purpose
* share your triumphs and your struggles
* be vulnerable - deeper daily checkins, more than just tasks... how are YOU
* communicate well and include kindness and respect
* handle bad news with extreme care
* watch your tone - edit emails particularly for tone
* put important things in a place where everyone knows they can find it
* paradolia: use emoji - it helps a lot in text communications. 
* express gratitude - early and often... just do it. 
* connect on a regular basis... put it on your schedule... make it more than about work. 
* use video chat
* create structures for spontaneous connections
* slack for ongoing chat
* do cheesy ice breakers
* find ways for remote people to join in at the office - put cameras everywhere!
* use inside jokes
* do Google hangouts just to hangout

This presentation was about making artistic animations with CSS.

What could you do with 100 days of making?

When looking at a blank canvas, we can feel really intimidated, by the scope of what we could accomplish.
It can be truly motivating to add constraints to the canvas. These are our ground rules within which we must work. 

Reasons to art in CSS
* you already know it
* you can do it anywhere
* discrete objects that can live
* pretty devent 3D
* uses the GPU
* learn your craft if your craft is CSS
* transcend the medium - maybe it can go into a book/gallery 

His contraints did NOT include cross-browser/optimization testing

The 3 Cs of Creative Coding
* copy, copy someone else to start
* change, push the limits of what you can do... change your craft
* chance, embrace happy accidents
* combine, mush all the Cs into one

Possible project for me: make the bigfont logo in pure CSS.

Homework
* Go make art. 
* Go to codepend and fork something.
* Come to PDX Creative Coders.
* Find a local meetup.
* Start a creative code group.
* A lonely square - one square surrounded by a field of white?`
* alonelysquare.com

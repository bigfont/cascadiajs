Delight.
Surprise.
Sadness.
Joy.

When you feel, the brain blinks.

Study
* the brain transmitted alpha, beta, and theta waves
* theta waves relate to dreaming
* in the study, participants dreamed while awake
* an increase in theta waves increased catcholamines
* they learned better w/ the theta waves
* they learned better when appreciating the details

The Web
* it started dryly because it was for academia
* the dryness is hard to recall
* the emotional interface helps us to recall (really?)
* engagement + trust = positive memory
* micro interactions help to create delightful interactions

Micro Interactions
* the first one of the Internet was the dial up girgle
* it's just a little interaction, a connection

Other Examples of Microsoft Interactions
* visual finish, add tiny subtleties
* personality, add characters with two eyes and a mouth (e.g. the firefox)
* humour and microcopy, combination of an instruction and comedy
    * "Stop looking at my bottom" on the bottom on a container.
* purposeful transitions, make transitions communication

In short, it's about attention to detail. 

Final Example
* basecamp signup page
* has a person whose arm points at the active input

1. First make something work. 
2. Then add attention to detail - delight. 
3. Then ship.

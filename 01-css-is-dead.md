Sass seems to have won as a preprocessor.

Nesting
* over nesting is a code smell for performance & debugging

Deprecation
* ways of doing it will break in the future

Configuration
* this can get tricky
* builds can take a really long time
* cannot just open CSS file and start editing

Abstraction
* it all just compiles down to CSS

CSS Flexbox
* it's ready for production

CSS Grid Module
* more layout options than flexbox has
* has the same usecase as flexbox

CSS Variables
* These are currently ready in Firefox

CSS @extend property

CSS Mixins
* @mixin and @include

CSS Nesting
* :matches

CSS Extensions
* super early, theoretical
* custom selectors

CSS Web Components

CSS @import
* In css the @import statement makes another http requezt
* in HTTP/2 allows multiple non-blocking requests, so it doesn't matter!

CSS Container queries 
* the holy grail of responsive web design (RWD)
* these allowing styling based on the size of the parent container
